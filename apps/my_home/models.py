ðŸŽ¯ Summary
Feature	Example
Create a Model	    class UserProfile(models.Model): ...
Define Fields	    username = models.CharField(max_length=150)
Use Relationships	user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
Control Ordering	class Meta: ordering = ['-created_at']
Save Data	        user.save()


Command	                What It Does	                                               When To Use
makemigrations	        Creates migration files (instructions for database changes)	   After modifying models.py
migrate	                Applies migration files to update the database	               After running makemigrations

Think of it like this:

makemigrations writes a plan (creates migration files).
migrate executes the plan (updates the actual database).

makemigrations: creates migration files, which are instructions for how Django should modify the database. (see 0001_intial/002_intial)

migrate: Django reads the migration file (0001_initial.py) and actually creates the table in the database.
